# prototype-Question-Answering-system
In this project, i will need to build a prototype Question Answering system by using
the semantic information embedded in a Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) file
called "glove.6B.50d_Reduced.csv" (included in the "resources" folder).
For example, if "London" is the capital of the "UK", then we would like the system
to identify that "Beijing" is the capital of "China"; or if the colour of "Apple" is "Red",
then the colour of "Banana" should be "Yellow". Moreover, by providing a specific
word, we would like the system to be able to find a list of words that are semantically
close to it. E.g. By saying "Computer", the system should list "Software", "Technology",
"Internet", "Computing" and "Devices" as the top 5 closest words. Or "Doctorate",
"Bachelor", "Thesis", "Dissertation" and "Graduate" should be the top 5 closest words
to "PhD". As mentioned already, we will use semantic embedding to achieve this, and a
brief introduction will be provided below to help you better understand this assignment.
